## Overview

<Message type="note">

This feature is currently in **beta** status.

</Message>

Cloud Twins are virtual representations of your physical assets. Technically, they are JSON document sets stored in the [Hub](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/hubs/). You can store and fetch data at any time in those documents.

A Cloud twin is associated to each [Device](/iot/iot-hub/reference-content/devices/) and *remains online* regardless of the actual device state.

* The Hub provides a REST API to all twins.
* The device has a dedicated inband API over MQTT to interact with its own twin.

## Document Store

Each twin is a document store, it can hold several JSON documents.
A Document is identified by the twin ID (`twin_id`) and a name.

As each device has a twin: the `twin_id` is equal to the corresponding `device_id`.

### Document Name

There is a restriction on the characters allowed to form a `document_name`. It can use letters, numbers, dash, underscore, dot and tilde only (`[-_.~0-9a-zA-Z]`).

<Message type="important">

The document named `_config` is reserved and cannot be used.

</Message>

<Message type="tip">

Create your documents such that both REST and MQTT inband API don't write the same. A good example is the `current_state` / `desired_state` pair.

</Message>

### Document Format

A document is a JSON formatted object with the following format:
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "data": {
    }
}
```

Where:
- `version` is the current version of the document, it starts at `1` and is incremented each time the document is changed.
- `data` can be filled with any valid JSON object of your choice.

<Message type="important">

Names starting with the underscore `_` character are reserved.
While valid, also avoid using special characters in your key name (in particular dot `.` and slash `/`).
(Both might conflict with future API and configuration options).

</Message>

## Accessing the documents

The concepts are similar for both MQTT and REST APIs, there are 3 basic operations you can do on a document:

1. **Get**: Get the content of a chosen document.
2. **Put**: Create or replace a document.
3. **Patch**: Update a part of a document (see patch format [below](#document-patch-format)).

### Simplified Version Handling

To manage concurrency and ensure each actor has a chance to modify the document without loosing changes done by another actor, the Twins provide optimistic locking through version numbers.

- A document is created with version 1.
- For each modifications the version is incremented by 1.
- To avoid data loss, an actor must provide the current version number along with the modifications to the document.
- If the provided version is incorrect, the operation is not done and an error is returned.

<Message type="note">

For simple case concurrency is not an issue. So providing version is optional: not setting it or setting it to 0, will ignore the version constraint for that request.

</Message>

### Document Patch Format

The Patch format is a regular JSON document respecting the following rules:

- Keys not in the patch are not modified.
- Keys with a null value in the patch are removed.
- Keys with non-null value behave this way:
  - Primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans) are replaced.
  - Arrays are fully replaced and cannot contain null values.
  - Objects sub-keys are updated using the same rules.

### Cloud twins REST API

The REST API is documented on the [Scaleway Developers Website](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/iot/api/#iot-cloud-twins-15fc60).

### Cloud twins inband MQTT API

The device can communicate with it's own twin through inband MQTT API.

The general use of the inband MQTT API is similar for all methods (get, put, patch):
1. Subscribe to the response topic.
2. Publish a request.

<Message type="note">

Inband API MQTT messages are not dispatched to other devices. A response is only sent to the connection issuing the request.

</Message>

#### Response Topics

The response topics are using the following scheme:
 - `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/<method>/response/error`
 - `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/<method>/response/success`

Where:
 - `<twin_id>` is the twin id or alternatively the string `me`.
 - `<document_name>` is the document name.
 - `<method>` is one of `get`, `put` or `patch`.

In case of an error, the response will arise on the ...`/error` topic with a payload formatted in JSON as follows:
```json
{
    "error": "<error message>"
}
```

In case of success, the response will arise on the ...`/success` topic with the (new) document:
```json
{
    "version": <x>,
    "data": {
        <...customer_data>
    }
}
```

#### The get method

To implement a get:
1. Subscribe to the `get` response topics.
2. Publish an empty payload on `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/get`.
3. You should receive the document on the `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/get/response/success` topic (or an error on the ...`/error` topic).

#### The put method

To implement a put:
1. Subscribe to the `put` response topics.
2. Publish a valid document JSON on `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/put`.
3. You should receive the document on the `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/put/response/success` topic (or an error on the ...`/error` topic).

<Message type="note">

See above about [version handling](#simplified-version-handling).

</Message>

#### The patch method

To implement a patch:
1. Subscribe to the `patch` response topics.
2. Publish a patch formatted document on `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/patch`.
3. You should receive the document on the `$SCW/twins/<twin_id>/<document_name>/patch/response/success` topic (or an error on the ...`/error` topic).

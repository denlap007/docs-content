By default, remote email ports (25, 465, 587) cannot be reached from our infrastructure to avoid spam. You will need to open the mail ports to send emails. You can enable them from the security group configuration.


<Message type="important">

 The SMTP ports are blocked by default for security reasons. To enable them, complete the identification process (KYC) and upgrade your account to Build level.

1. Click **Instances** on the side menu of the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com).

2. Click the **Security Groups** tab.

3. Select the security group for which you want to enable SMTP ports.
